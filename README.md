Deep reinforcement learning for Healthcare data

Class project for CS282 at Harvard
I worked with Camilo Fosco on building a decision making system for physicians in the ICU

The idea was to use ICNN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07152) and DDQN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461) to improve the results of https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09602 and make them more interpretable.
We also tried to build VAE (https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) for temporal series, to find a fixed, continuous representation of patient health states.
