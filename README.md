# VAE for patient histories modeling

* `models.py` contains useful layers for the VAE
* `vae.py` contains the encoder and the decoder
* `parallelization.py` contains code that allows to train a model om multiple GPU (not sure it is functional though)
* `VAE.ipynb` is an example of how to build the VAE (with the loss and everything)

Evaluation for project CS282:

Check correlations between the data and our outputs. Analyze what is creating the results and why. 
Try different hyperparameters to have a sense of what is impacting our outputs the most.
